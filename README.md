I am an Energy Engineering student with interests in the fields of Data Science and Artificial Intelligence. As academic and professional goals, I aim to unite those areas and explore the usage of data analysis as decision making tools for the energy industry and society.

**Previous work experiences:**
- Between 2018 and 2019 I worked as a Data Scientist intern generating data analysis and developing machine learning models for defaults prediction in the electric power market. (Brazil)
- During 2020 I worked in the LNG business both as a LNG Trading Analyst and Commercial Operator. There, I was able to bring value to the team through data analysis of the gas market, development of a global LNG scenarios/supply and demand model with predictive functionality to support decision making and digitalization of processes. (Austria)

Recently I transferred my studies to Politecnico di Torino (Italy) in order to finish my degree in Energy Engineering.
